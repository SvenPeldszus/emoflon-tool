pattern moveFigure {

// Patterns are a declarative, rule-based approach to transforming models, meaning that you do not have to specify exactly HOW or
// in what order a change should take place. Pattern-matching is entirely non-deterministic, using black, green, and red 
// operators to indicate elements that should be matched (checked to exist), created, or destroyed upon pattern execution. Patterns also
// manipulate binding states to determine whether or not an element's value was fixed beforehand.

// You are encouraged to read Part 3: Story Driven Modelling of the eMoflon handbook for more details about this topic.
