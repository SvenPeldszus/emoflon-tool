represents a novel approach for visualizing and exploring large
networked information structures that may represent, for instance,
linked information resources such as complex organizational
structures or metadata networks such as ontologies. An interactive
matrix display is used for showing relations between concepts and
concept hierarchies are displayed by well known tree widgets along
the two axes of a matrix.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The
central idea of the MatrixBrowser is to map the underlying graph
structure to a highly interactive adjacency matrix (Figure 1).
Adjacency matrices are a well-understood alternative graph
representation where the nodes of the network are shown along the
horizontal and vertical axes of a matrix. Both the direction of an
association (for directed graphs) as well as different types of
associations are visualized by using arrows and graphical symbols
shown inside the cells. This can be done in conjunction with other
techniques such as tool tip descriptions of different association
types. Displaying all nodes on both axis of the matrix is the
simplest possibility the MatrixBrowser provides to represent a
network. As an extension of this standard matrix model is that
MatrixBrowser provides mechanisms for presenting hierarchical
information structures directly as interactive tree widgets. This
“Windows Explorer”-like technique is widely known and intuitive
to use. Information networks typically contain hierarchical
substructures that may either be based on merely syntactic properties
of the graph or on the semantic types of the relations, e.g.
subClassOf relationships. These are extracted automatically by
MatrixBrowser.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">In
MatrixBrowser, the user can flexibly place such hierarchical
substructures along both axes and explore them with the familiar
expand/collapse procedure. In this way, the information shown in the
matrix can be better structured and the amount of visually displayed
material reduced.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">As
a result of using tree widgets as axes of the matrix, not all
concepts and relations are visible all the time. MatrixBrowser allows
using expand/collapse functions not only for the trees but also for
the cells. If the explicit relations in the net are not visible
because their super ordinate concepts are in a collapsed state, an
interactive symbol is shown, that can be clicked for
expanding/collapsing the associated trees. With these techniques, the
user can flexibly drill-down into the network or condense parts of
it.</FONT></P>

<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">A
table in the upper left corner of the matrix shows all of the
neighbors and their relations in the net of a node, which is selected
in one of the two hierarchies. So not only the context of a node
within the hierarchies but also in the net can be seen easily.</FONT></P>

collapsing and expanding nodes.</FONT></P>

subsets of nodes displayed on the axes of the matrix can either be
those parts of a network that represent hierarchical substructures or
the results of queries or filtering mechanisms. Hierarchies placed
along the axes can be explored directly by expanding and collapsing
their interactive trees. This familiar and effective kind of
exploration works both on the horizontal and the vertical axis. The
flexible methods to show user defined subsets of the information
source on the axes enables the user to reduce, increase and navigate
on the displayed part of the networked data.</FONT></P>

<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The
relations shown in the cells of the matrix for two currently selected
sets of nodes are always consistent with the current interactive
state of the axes. In order to achieve this consistency in the
visualization, a number of issues need to be solved. The first issue
concerns the visibility of relations for nodes that are currently not
displayed in the tree because their super ordinate nodes are in a
collapsed state. A second issue arises for transitive relations where
the relations between two nodes can be propagated up or down in the
hierarchy this node is part of. For example, in a scenario
representing the organizational structure of a company linked to the
different locations of the units, a unit located in a particular city
is also located in the country and the continent that city lies in.
Whether or not such inferences are made, depends on the type of the
relations in the hierarchy, that is to say if they are transitive or
not. The transitivity of a relation can be derived by rules in the
underlying ontology and the use of suitable inference mechanisms. The
visualization engine, however, is able to deal with all the different
cases. For this purpose, MatrixBrowser provides different interactive
types of relations in the cells of the matrix. If a cell of the
matrix is marked, it can represent one of the following cases:</FONT></P>

	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><SPAN LANG="en-GB">An
	<I>explicit relation</I> represents a link explicitly specified
	between two nodes in the underlying graph. </SPAN><SPAN LANG="de-DE">This
	link may also be semantically typed.</SPAN></FONT></P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">A
	<I>hidden relation</I> is an indicator that an explicit relation is
	located somewhere lower in the hierarchy of the nodes, but is
	currently not visible because a super ordinate node has been
	collapsed.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">An
	<I>implicit relation</I> is a relation that has been derived from
	the underlying graph by some inference mechanism. Implicit relations
	can be either of an inheritance type, where a relation is propagated
	downward in a hierarchy, or of a generalization type where the
	propagation works upward. In the latter case, a cell marked with
	this type indicates that by expanding the axial node hierarchies,
	the explicit relation that was the source of the inference can be
	found somewhere lower in the hierarchy.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">An
	<I>equality relation </I>represents a link between nodes in case
	they are the same but member of different hierarchies.</FONT></P>
</UL>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">These
different types of relations are indicated through different symbols
shown in the cells. Both hidden and implicit relations
(generalizations) can be expanded just like nodes in a tree widget by
clicking on them (both are marked with a ‘+’ sign). Through a
<I>tight coupling</I> between cells and hierarchies shown on the
axes, expanding a relation also expands the nodes that belong to that
relation. In this way, the user can flexibly explore the information
structure both by selecting and filtering those parts of the complete
graph to be shown in the matrix and by interactively drilling down
from high-level concepts to lower-level nodes and relations.</FONT></P>
